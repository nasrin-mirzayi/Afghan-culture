   <h1 class="center">Kabul</h1>
    <h3>Landscape</h3>

<p>Situated in one of a number of high-altitude basins in the region, Kabul lies at an elevation of about 5,900 feet (1,800 metres) in the east-central part of the country, in a triangular valley between the Āsamāʾī and Sherdawaza mountain ranges. The Kabul River flows through the city on its way to join the Indus in northern Pakistan, to the east. This natural environment—particularly, the backdrop of the Paghmān and Dāmaneh-ye Kōh mountain ranges to the west and southwest and the Ṣāfī range to the east—provides a striking setting.The core of the city remains on the north bank of the Kabul River, where government and business functions became established during the course of the 20th century. As the value of land and property in the central area rose, both commercial and residential development spread over the market gardens that surrounded the city. The development in the 1950s of new neighbourhoods, such as Kheyrkhāneh to the northwest and Kārteh-ye Seh and Kōteh-ye Sangī to the southwest, resulted in secondary hubs of commerce and residential development, with some government functions being decentralized to these parts. During the 1980s the city grew, owing to an influx of migrants from conflict-affected rural areas. Fighting in the city in 1993–94 resulted in the displacement of up to half of the population. Some resettlement took place after 1995, but there was very limited development during the Taliban administration from 1996 to 2001. Investments since 2002 in public facilities and private real estate have transformed the city centre, with previously leafy avenues and elegant villas being obliterated by speculative high-rise structures.</p>
    
        <h3>Climate</h3>
<p>Kabul enjoys a semiarid continental climate, with rain in spring and when the trough of the summer monsoon reaches the highlands in early August. Summer temperatures average around 90 °F (32 °C), although a diurnal difference of 20 °C is not uncommon. Winter temperatures average 20 °F (− 5 °C) and can be accompanied by heavy snowfall.</p>
   
<h3>People</h3><p>
Kabul has historically been the melting pot of the diverse ethnic groups who inhabit Afghanistan. As well as Pashtun and Tajik communities, who make up the majority of Afghans, there is a significant Ḥazāra population, along with Uzbek, Turkmen, and other groups. While the majority of the population is Muslim, there are also Sikh and Hindu communities in the city. Since the 1980s, rural communities displaced to the city as a result of conflict have made up a growing proportion of the urban population.

</p> 
<h3>culture life</h3>
<p>Among the major cultural facilities in Kabul is the National Museum of Afghanistan, in the Dārulāmān area, reopened in 2004 after being looted and damaged during factional fighting in 1993–94. Due to constraints on space, only a small proportion of its rich collection of artifacts is on display. The National Archives, in the Āsmāʾī Wāt area, has an excellent collection of rare manuscripts, but access is restricted. The National Gallery in Andārabī houses a permanent collection of paintings. There is also a French Cultural Centre, adjoining the Lycée Istiqlal, and the Goethe Institute.</p>
